# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
End-to-End Machine Learning Project | Business-Focused Customer Analytics
🚀 **Project Summary**

Built an end-to-end Customer Segmentation system to group customers based on behavioral patterns using unsupervised machine learning.

The project demonstrates:
Strong understanding of EDA & feature engineering.
Practical implementation of K-Means Clustering.
Business-oriented cluster interpretation.
Deployment-ready ML solution using Streamlit.

🎯 **Business Problem**

Businesses often struggle to personalize marketing due to diverse customer behavior.
This project answers:
How can we automatically segment customers into meaningful groups to improve targeting, retention, and revenue?

🧠 **Technical Approach**
1️⃣ Data Preprocessing
Data cleaning & validation.
Feature scaling using StandardScaler.
Outlier inspection.
Feature selection for clustering.

2️⃣ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
Distribution analysis.
Correlation heatmaps.
Behavioral pattern visualization.
Cluster separation insights.

3️⃣ **Model Development:**
Applied K-Means Clustering.
Used Elbow Method to determine optimal K.
Cluster labeling & centroid analysis.
Interpretation of customer personas.

4️⃣ **Deployment:**
Built an interactive Streamlit web application.
Real-time customer segment prediction.
User-friendly UI for business stakeholders.

📈 **Key Outcomes:**
